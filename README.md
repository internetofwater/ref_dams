# Reference dams for geoconnex.us

This repository houses workflow software for compilation of community reference dams. The output of this workflow will generate Persistent Identifiers for the [geoconnex.us system](https://github.com/internetofwater/geoconnex.us), reference landing page content for the [reference.geoconnex.us system](https://reference.geoconnex.us/), and a set of best available network locations for the [Network Linked Data Index](https://labs.waterdata.usgs.gov/about-nldi/index.html).

The base dataset that informs this work can be found at in the "Final_NID_2018.zip" file associated with this data release:

> Wieczorek, M.E., Wolock, D.M., and McCarthy, P.M., 2021, Dam impact/disturbance metrics for the conterminous United States, 1800 to 2018: U.S. Geological Survey data release, https://doi.org/10.5066/P92S9ZX6. 

These reference locations are intended to be a shared community resource that anyone can contribute to.

# Architecture

This project exists in a linked data architecture that relies on Web uniform resource identifiers (URIs) for both digital and real world entities. 

There are three types of resources in the architecture:
1. Real-world dams identified by a so-called "non-information URI".
1. Community reference information about the real world dam identified by a URL that is the target of a redirect from a non-information URI.
1. A particular organization's information available for the real world monitoring location.

In practice, these urls will look like: 
1. `https://geoconnex.us/ref/dams/1000047` (which will redirect to 2)
1. `https://reference.geoconnex.us/collections/dams/items/1000047` (which will provide information about the reference location, including a link to 3)
1. `https://nid.sec.usace.army.mil#/dams/system/####/summary` (which is the USACE's site information for this particular reference location.)

It is important to maintain this separation because no one organization, other than a community organization set up to fulfill this role, can be expected to be both the community reference catalog and a provider of their own information.  

# Project structure

- `/R` functions defined for this project.
- `/data` data downloaded for this project.
- `/temp` temporary output that may be of interest for debugging.
- `/out` output to be contributed elsewhere. 
- `/reg` registry of dams tracked in source control.
- `/docs` contains artifacts to be served via github.io

# Contributing

First, thank you for considering a contribution! For this to work, everyone with unique dam locations need to be willing to contribute those locations here. 

This is a new project and, as such, exactly how contributions are made will be flexible and a work in progress. If you have locations to add, just reach out [in the issues](https://github.com/internetofwater/ref_dams/issues) and/or submit a pull request. The maintainer(s) are more than happy to coordinate and do whatever legwork is needed to get new reference locations into the registry.

As time goes on and the nature of contributions becomes more clear, this guidance will become more specific, but until then, just get in touch and we'll work together.
